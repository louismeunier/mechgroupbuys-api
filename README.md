# mechgroupbuys api

An API wrapper of www.mechgroupbuys.com currently located at https://us-central1-mechgroupbuysapi.cloudfunctions.net/app/. Currently *very* rough and quickly put together.


*I am not associated with www.mechgroupbuys.com AT ALL. If you would like me to take down this API let me know.*


# use
Send a `GET` request to:
```https://us-central1-mechgroupbuysapi.cloudfunctions.net/app/{type}?status={status}```

`type`
 - `keyboards` 
 - `keycaps` 
 - `switches`

`status`
 - `live`
 - `upcoming`
 - `ic`
 - `ended`

# info
This project was mostly for fun as well as a way to get to learn firebase functions, APIs, etc, better. I currently have no plans on working on it further, but we'll see.
